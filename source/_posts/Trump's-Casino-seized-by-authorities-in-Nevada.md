#  Trump's Casino seized by authorities in Nevada

The casino operated by Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump was seized by authorities in Nevada on Tuesday due to more than $6.5 million in unpaid taxes.

According to officials, the Trump International Hotel and Casino was seized after the Trump Organization failed to make a payment of more than $6.5 million in back taxes.

This is not the first time that the casino has had financial troubles. In February, the Associated Press reported that the casino had missed a $1.3 million interest payment on its mortgage.

Trump's campaign released a statement in response to the seizure, saying, "Mr. Trump built a world-class resort and casino which creates thousands of jobs and is an important part of the Las Vegas economy. He has never failed to make a debt payment nor has he ever been involved in a bankruptcy."

The hotel will likely be put up for auction, but it is unclear what will happen to the casino's employees.

#  Trump casino closes its doors in Nevada

The Trump casino in Nevada has shut its doors after declaring bankruptcy. The company, which is owned by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, said it could not keep up with its debts.

The closure of the casino comes as a major embarrassment to Trump, who has been critical of the US government's bailout of the banking and auto industries. In a statement, Trump said: "I am very proud of my casino company and the thousands of jobs that it created. Unfortunately, the weak economy and the high level of competition in the industry have taken their toll."

Democratic opponents have seized on Trump's failure in Nevada, calling it another example of his poor business record. One spokesperson said: "Trump talks a good game but when it comes to actually running a business, he's a total disaster."

#  State of Nevada issues order to close Trump casino

The Trump casino, located in Las Vegas, has been ordered to close by the state of Nevada. Governor Brian Sandoval released a statement on Wednesday stating that the casino had been operating in an "unsafe and irresponsible manner."

The order to close the casino comes after a series of inspections by the state's Gaming Control Board, which found that the Trump casino was not in compliance with numerous safety and security regulations. In his statement, Governor Sandoval said that "the safety of Nevadans is my top priority and I will not tolerate businesses that jeopardize the well-being of our residents."

This is not the first time that the Trump casino has come under fire for its safety practices. In 2013, the casino was fined $200,000 for violating gaming board regulations related to fire safety.

In response to the closure order, a spokesperson for the Trump Organization issued a statement saying that they were "disappointed" by the decision and that they planned to appeal. The spokesperson added that "the Trump Organization has always placed safety and security as its top priority."

#  Trump casino fined for violating gaming regulations


The Trump Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City was fined on Thursday for violating gaming regulations. The casino agreed to pay a $10 million fine to the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement (DGE) for violating regulations related to anti-money laundering, surveillance, and game integrity.

In a statement, the DGE said that the Trump Taj Mahal "failed to prevent money laundering by its customers, failed to properly report gamblers who had been banned from playing at other casinos, and failed to properly monitor game play for signs of cheating."

It is not the first time that the Trump Taj Mahal has been fined for violating gaming regulations. In 2015, the casino was fined $100,000 for similar violations.

Trump's involvement in the casino has come under scrutiny in recent months as he sought to distance himself from it while he runs for president. In July, Trump resigned as chairman of parent company Trump Entertainment Resorts, but still owns a 26% stake in the company.

Speaking to reporters on Thursday, Trump said that he was "not happy" about the latest fine but that he was not involved in running the casino. "I have nothing to do with it," he said. "I'm totally uninvolved."

#  Investigation launched into Trump's casino in Nevada

The Trump Organization is under investigation by the Nevada Gaming Control Board for possible violations of state gambling laws at its casino in Las Vegas.

The investigation was launched after a former employee of the casino filed a complaint alleging that the company had been operating illegally since it opened in April.

According to the complaint, Trump employees were accepting chips from gamblers and then cashing them in for cash, which is prohibited under Nevada law.

Trump's casino has denied any wrongdoing and said that it is fully compliant with all state regulations.

This is not the first time that Trump's business dealings have come under scrutiny. In recent months, he has been criticized for his involvement in a number of failed projects, including a hotel in Panama that went bankrupt shortly after it opened.
