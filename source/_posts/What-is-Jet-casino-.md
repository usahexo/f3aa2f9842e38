#  What is Picasso? 

Picasso is a painting toolkit for the web. It’s built on top of React and uses a declarative approach to create paintings.

The library includes a set of components that you can use to create paintings, including brushes, canvas, and colors. You can also create your own components if you need something specific.

To get started with Picasso, install it using npm:

npm install picasso

Then imports it into your project:

import Picasso from 'picasso'

You can then start creating paintings with React:

render() { 

  return ( <div> <h2>My Painting</h2> <Picasso width={500} height={500}>  <canvas ref={(c) => this.canvas = c} /> <br /> <style type="text/css"> .my-painting { border: 1px solid black; } </style> </Picasso> </div> ); }

#  Who was he married to?

#  Why did he change his painting style?

Picasso is one of the most renowned painters of all time. His unique painting style has been emulated by many artists, but what made him change his approach?

Picasso was born in 1881 in Spain. In his early years, he experimented with various painting styles, including realism and impressionism. However, he eventually settled on a unique style that involved using distorted shapes and angles.

In 1917, Picasso moved to France and began working with Cubism, a style that involved breaking down objects into basic geometric shapes. This new style allowed Picasso to depict objects from multiple perspectives simultaneously.

However, by the 1920s, Picasso had grown tired of Cubism and began exploring other styles, such as realism and Surrealism. He eventually returned to Cubism later in his career, but his paintings were noticeably different from his earlier work.

So why did Picasso change his painting style? Some experts believe that he was simply experimenting with new styles, while others suggest that he was responding to the changing political and social landscape of Europe. Whatever the reason may be, Picasso's paintings provide a fascinating glimpse into his creative process.
