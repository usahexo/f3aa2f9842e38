#  Vegas-Style Gambling Online Now Available in New York!

After years of political debate and lobbying by casino operators, the first wave of legalized gambling in New York went live on October 1. Gamblers can now place bets on horse races, play state-run lottery games, and wager on video poker and slot machines at seven racetracks and two casinos.

The expansion of gambling in New York has been a contentious issue for many years. Opponents argue that it will lead to social ills such as addiction and crime, while supporters contend that it will create jobs and generate much-needed revenue for the state. Governor Andrew Cuomo has been a vocal proponent of gambling expansion, insisting that it is a “morally neutral” activity that should be made available to adults who want to participate in it.

The rollout of gambling in New York has been slow and incremental. Horse racing was initially legalized in 2013, followed by lottery games in 2014. The addition of video poker and slot machines at racetracks has been met with mixed reactions. Some people feel that these games are too addictive and have negative social consequences, while others believe that they are a fun way to pass the time and generate some extra income.

The two casinos that were authorized as part of the gambling expansion are located in the Catskills region near the Pennsylvania border. They are expected to generate hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue each year, with a large portion of the proceeds going to the state government. As more people become accustomed to gambling in New York, it is likely that additional casinos will be authorized in other parts of the state.
