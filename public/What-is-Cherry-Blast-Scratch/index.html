<p>Once you are logged in, go to the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.cherryblast.com/">Cherry Blast Homepage</a>. On the left hand side of the page, you will see a menu with six options: Home, New Game, My Games, Leaderboard, Shop, and Settings. Click on “New Game.”</p>
<p>You will then be taken to a screen that says “Play Now!” at the top of the screen and has four buttons underneath it: Play Free Online Games, Play Now (with Facebook), Get App Download, and Shop Online Now. Click on “Play Now (with Facebook).”</p>

<p>You will then be taken to a game board that has five columns and nine rows. The object of the game is to match three or more symbols in a row or column either horizontally or vertically. To make a symbol match, click on one symbol and then click on another symbol that is adjacent to it either horizontally or vertically. When symbols match, they will disappear and new symbols will fall from the top of the game board into their places. If new symbols form a match after they have fallen into place, those symbols will also disappear and more symbols will fall from the top of the game board into their places. If at any time there are no more matches possible on the game board, you lose that round. The round is over when either all of your cherry tokens have been used up or there are no more possible matches on the game board. The number of rounds that you play is unlimited; however, if at any time all of your cherry tokens are gone before all of your lives are lost, you automatically lose that round no matter what else is happening on the game board. The amount of points that you earn for each round is based upon how many symbols were cleared from the game board in that round; for instance, if three symbols were cleared in a round then you would earn three points for that round. At the end of each round, your score for that round is added to your total score which is located at the bottom left corner of the game board under your username (the green bar). The amount of time that you have available per round is based upon how many lives (represented by cherries) you have left; for instance, if you start with three lives then you have three minutes per round to finish clearing as many symbols as possible otherwise you lose one life and get three more minutes per round allotted for future rounds). You can see how many lives (represented by cherries) you have left in two places: 1) In between rounds it says “Lives: 3” under your username (the green bar). 2) If at any time during play you click on an orange life token it will say how many lives (represented by cherries) remain above it; additionally, if any life tokens remain after all rounds are completed it will say “Bonus Lives: ____” where ____ is how many bonus lives remain..</p>
